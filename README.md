<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aditya Porwal</h1> <h3 align="center">From coding adventures in India to data-driven journeys in Canada, I transform raw data into compelling narratives.</h3> <p align="left">My story began in the vibrant halls of my university in India, where I dove into the intricate world of Electronics and Communication Engineering. I developed a deep understanding of  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/cplusplus/cplusplus-original.svg" alt="C++" width="20" height="20"/> and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="Python" width="20" height="20"/>, which quickly became my preferred tools for exploring data and system design. This passion led to one of my proudest achievementsâ€”a deep learning-based video summarization project, which culminated in a research paper published in the Springer Journal and also a <strong>Gold Medal </strong> at my University.</p> <p align="left">Continuing my academic journey, I moved to Canada to pursue a Master of Engineering at the University of Calgary. Here, I delved deeper into the realms of <strong>Machine Learning</strong> <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/tensorflow/tensorflow-icon.svg" alt="TensorFlow" width="20" height="20"/> and <strong>AI</strong>, working extensively with <strong>Pandas</strong> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/2ae2a900d2f041da66e950e4d48052658d850630/icons/pandas/pandas-original.svg" alt="Pandas" width="20" height="20"/> and <strong>Scikit-learn</strong> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Scikit_learn_logo_small.svg" alt="Scikit-learn" width="20" height="20"/> to extract valuable insights from large datasets and build predictive models. During this time, I also became fascinated by <strong>Data Engineering</strong>, gaining hands-on experience with <strong>SQL</strong> <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/postgresql/postgresql-icon.svg" alt="SQL" width="20" height="20"/> to design robust databases and <strong>Apache Spark</strong> <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/apache_spark/apache_spark-icon.svg" alt="Apache Spark" width="20" height="20"/> to handle big data processing efficiently.</p> <p align="left">I built scalable data pipelines using <strong>Airflow</strong>, integrating batch and real-time data sources. My ability to automate data workflows with <strong>Python</strong> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="Python" width="20" height="20"/> and optimize queries with <strong>Snowflake</strong> <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/snowflake/snowflake-icon.svg" alt="Snowflake" width="20" height="20"/> allowed me to streamline data processing, ensuring that high-quality data was available for machine learning models.</p> <p align="left">During my time at AltaML, I gained hands-on experience with <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/tensorflow/tensorflow-icon.svg" alt="TensorFlow" width="20" height="20"/> and <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/pytorch/pytorch-icon.svg" alt="PyTorch" width="20" height="20"/>, developing machine learning models that predicted customer revenue and churn probabilities. My work in this role was driven by a focus on efficiency, using <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/docker/docker-original-wordmark.svg" alt="Docker" width="20" height="20"/> to streamline deployments and automate processes.</p> <p align="left">As my career evolved, I transitioned into Full Stack Development, building applications with <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/react/react-original-wordmark.svg" alt="React" width="20" height="20"/> on the front end and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/nodejs/nodejs-original-wordmark.svg" alt="Node.js" width="20" height="20"/> for the backend. Iâ€™ve worked with <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/mongodb/mongodb-original-wordmark.svg" alt="MongoDB" width="20" height="20"/> and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/postgresql/postgresql-original-wordmark.svg" alt="PostgreSQL" width="20" height="20"/> to manage large-scale databases, ensuring scalability and security in the systems I build.</p> <p align="left">Today, I continue to explore new challenges in <strong>Data Science</strong> and <strong>Web Development</strong>, always eager to combine technical expertise with creative problem-solving. Letâ€™s connect and explore the limitless possibilities of tech together!</p>
